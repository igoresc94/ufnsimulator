<p>This Simulator was coded by MA Igor Carnaúba to teach Disinformation in EU Politics through AI to bachelor students at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.</p>
<p>By writing a country, disinformation technique, text and uploading an image, students write their disinformation/tacking disinformation post and and everybody will be able to see the way they are working with their countries.</p>
<p>Feel free to check it out and check how chairs can be changed as they act.</p>
